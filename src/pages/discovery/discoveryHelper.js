/**
 * Module for all filter arrays. Each filter array represents a sub-section of the columns available in the cumulative
 * CalTech dataset. Filter arrays and their elements are mutually exclusive and non-overlapping.
 *
 * The filter arrays contain an object for each database column. The object describes the name of the data column, the
 * label, and the dataType. The latter is not the data type the database returns but rather the data type the data can
 * be coerced to. This is important for the SQL "where" part of the query string submitted to the API. Essentially, a
 * data column can contain 4 types of different data which beckon different filter methods:
 * 	1) string data (e.g. names): filter with a text input field
 * 	2) number data (e.g. ID or coordinates): filter with >, <, = and number input field
 * 	3) enum data (e.g. type, classifications, etc): filter with enum drop-down box
 * 	4) date data: filter with <, >, = date input field

The integer part designates the target star; the two-digit decimal part identifies a unique transiting object associated with that star.

It is therefore critical that the scientific community not conduct sample completeness studies on KOI tables that remain ACTIVE. Active tables do, however, provide the latest information for community scientists interested in follow-up observations and disposition activities. After a period of activity, the classification of the KOI table will change from ACTIVE to DONE when all dispositions are judged as final and all model parameters have been updated appropriately. This will typically occur after a new delivery of TCEs to the archive based on a longer data baseline.',

The value of this flag may change over time as the evaluation of KOIs proceeds to deeper levels of analysis using Kepler time-series pixel and light curve data, or follow-up observations. A not dispositioned value corresponds to objects for which the disposition tests have not yet been completed. A false positive has failed at least one of the tests described in Batalha et al. (2012). A planetary candidate has passed all prior tests conducted to identify false positives, although this does not a priori mean that all possible tests have been conducted. A future test may confirm this KOI as a false positive. False positives can occur when: 1) the KOI is in reality an eclipsing binary star, 2) the Kepler light curve is contaminated by a background eclipsing binary, 3) stellar variability is confused for coherent planetary transits, or 4) instrumental artifacts are confused for coherent planetary transits.',
